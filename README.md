Computing questions:
1. Create a 2 player blackjack game where both players have 3 cards, and all 3 cards are generated randomly. The player with a higher total value of the 3 cards wins. But if the total number of the 3 cards exceeds 21, they lose. 
If both player cards exceed 21 points, it results in a draw
2. Write a Python code that takes a string as input and returns the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, given the input 'xyzxyzxyab', the function should return 'xyz', and for â€˜mmmmmm', it should return 'm'."
3. Write a Python code that simulates a playlist manager. The program should allow users to create playlists, add songs to playlists, remove songs from playlists, shuffle playlists, and play songs from playlists. Additionally, implement a feature that keeps track of the play count for each song in the playlist, and the program should have a function to display the top N most played songs. 
4. Write a Python program that simulates a student management system. The program should use a dictionary to store student information, where the keys are student IDs and the values are dictionaries containing the student's name, age, and grades in three subjects (e.g., Math, Science, English). Implement functions to:
5. Validate a phone number with 8 digit 
6. The 12th digit of a GTIN-12 is a calculated digit based on a MOD check digit calculation from the 11 preceding digits. The check digit prevents substitution error, which would result if one digit read as another. It would be better for a barcode to not scan at all than to scan as an incorrect product.
  UPC (GTIN-12)
  Check Digit
  The 12th digit of a GTIN-12 is a calculated digit based on a MOD check digit calculation from the 11 preceding digits. The check digit prevents substitution error, which would result if one digit read as another. It would be better for a barcode to not scan at all than to scan as an incorrect product.
  To calculate a GTIN-12 check digit CALCULATE
  To manually calculate the check digit using modulo algorithm, follow these 5 steps;Example: If the first 11 digits of GTIN-12 is; 01234567890
  Step 1:
  Add all of the ODD positions (1,3,5,7,9,11)
  Step 2:
  Multiply value from Step 1 by 3
  Step 3:
  Add all of the EVEN positions (2,4,6,8,10)
  Step 4:
  Add value from STEP 2 and STEP 3 together
  Step 5:
  Determine what number is needed to make value from STEP 4 into a multiple of 10
7. Read from the file Words.txt and select all the word that start with d and end with r
8. Write a Python script that manages a list of products stored in a JSON file. Your script should include functions to add a new product, update an existing product's information, and remove a product from the list. Additionally, create a function to save the modified list back to the JSON file. Finally, demonstrate the usage of these functions by adding a new product, updating an existing product's price, and removing a product, printing the modified list of products after each operation.
9. explain the term encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
10. Write a class Bankaccount with the constructor method with getters and setters with deposit and withdraw method
11. Create a child class saving account from the Bank account that inherit its method and attribute
12. implement linear search and binary search
13. implement bubble sort
14. implement insertion sort
15. implement quick sort
16. implement merge sort
17. implement linked list with node class and linkedlist class
In the linkedlist class, implement function, insert head, insert tail, delete head delete tail
18. implement stack and queue classes
